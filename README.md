### Detail

#### Register a GitHub App

[Register a new GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/), providing a `GitHub App name`, and `Homepage URL`, and having the following properties:

**Permissions**

1. `Repository contents`: Read only

**Event subscriptions**

1. `Push`

**Webhook URL**

For now, use a temporary value, such as `http://localhost`, we'll come back to this shortly.

**Webhook Secret**

Be sure to [secure your webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/), to ensure the authenticity of requests from GitHub, by providing a `Webhook Secret`. Use a random string with high entropy (e.g., by taking the output of `ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'` at the terminal).

**Private key**

After creating the GitHub App, be sure to [generate a private key](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#generating-a-private-key), store this in a safe place.

#### Create a SendGrid API key

[Sign up for a _free_ SendGrid account](https://app.sendgrid.com/signup), and [create an API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) with Mail Send access.

##### Domain authentication

It is recommended to set up [domain authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Sender_authentication/How_to_set_up_domain_authentication.html) in SendGrid in order to signal to email providers that SendGrid has permission to send emails on your behalf.

#### Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/osowskit/probot-emailer/tree/master)

[Deploy your app to Heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/osowskit/probot-emailer/tree/master), populating the `Config Vars` with your GitHub App's `APP_ID`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `PRIVATE_KEY`, as well as your SendGrid API key, `SENDGRID_APIKEY`.

#### Update your GitHub App

Update your GitHub App's `Webhook URL`, with the `URL` of your Heroku app.

#### Install your GitHub App

Install your GitHub App on the account, or repository that you wish to receive email notifications from.

#### Configure your installation

Configure the installed app, by creating a `.github/probot-messenger.yml` file in the root of the repository, for example:

```yaml
---
services:
- name: email
  addresses: # a list of addresses to send notifications to
  - to@example.com
  sender: # the email address of the notification sender
    name: From
    address: from@example.com
```

Consider adding your `sender.from` address as a contact, to avoid it being flagged as spam.

## Usage

Once configured, a push to any branch of a configured repository will generate a notification to the addresses defined in your `.github/probot-messenger.yml`.
